I need some one good at API integration for a small school project.
The task is to read the API ( unauthenticated and open) and list them in a designated order as the API contents are not in order (Alphabetical order).
This is a very urgent project and i need this as soon as possible (within 24 hours).
The API is very simple can happy to share the details in message.

* Should display Error message when the request return Error or unreachable.
* Should handle CORS error with proxy configuration.
* Need a reload button to refresh contents
* Need to style the results according to design.
* Should put comments on the code.
*Should be able to run in dev mode as well as build it as a bundle for production deployment.

API is available here
http://eacodingtest.digital.energyaustralia.com.au/api-docs/

eg:
http://eacodingtest.digital.energyaustralia.com.au/api/v1/festivals

We need to list the data in the following order. All entries should be sorted alphabetically.
As you can see the data is API is in a different format

Eg:

Record Label 1
Band X
Omega Festival
Band Y

Record Label 2
Band A
Alpha Festival
Beta Festival

The design should look like the attached screenshot.
Please note that this is a school project, so you need to arrange the components, services and put comments as much as you can. Also, let me know if you know how to integrate service workers for offline caching. It is optional, but if you can implement that, then that would be very good. Let me know if you can do this. Also please note that this is very urgent.
I hope this will help you to understand the design.
This is not the exact project, but mostly similar.
This is done in react js. As you can see the down arrow button will expand the festival list when we click and collapsed it back once you click it again.
